\section{PROJECT}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
\item Name: Automatic Stirrup Making Machine
\item During: Sem 7 \& 8
\item Description: The project was undertaken to study and design a model of automatic stirrups making machine using Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), which will change the conventional practices of cutting and bending the rod to make stirrups of different size and various shapes.
